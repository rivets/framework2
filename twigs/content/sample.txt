    There several variables you can set at the top of a Twig to control some of the things
    that the Framework includes in the output. Look at twigs/content/page.twig to see all
    the possible variables and how they are used.

{#
    If your page uses AJAX include this line at the start of the file - it loads a different version of jQuery.

{% set fwutils = TRUE %}
#}
{#
    If your page uses Parsley include this line at the start of the file
{% set parsley = TRUE %}
#}
{#
    If your page uses the inline editable package include this line at the start of the file
{% set editable = TRUE %}
#}

{#
